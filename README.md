# the plan is to do Find my iPhone for Apple but in a better way with session expired message in better position.
# first I did the border of the phone (div class ), then I insert all the divs in it. 
# insert the picture for find my iPhone and then the text below it (Find my iphone), then the input AppleID and password.
# Sign in with a message when clicked.
